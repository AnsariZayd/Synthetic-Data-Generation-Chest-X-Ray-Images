# Synthetic Chest X-Ray Image Generation System

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a synthetic chest X-ray image generation system using a diffusion-based generative model fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The system enables the generation of high-quality, clinically accurate synthetic chest X-ray images conditioned on textual prompts. It is designed for use in medical research, training AI diagnostic models, and augmenting datasets for medical education.

## Features

- **Text-Conditioned Image Generation**: Generate chest X-ray images based on user-defined clinical prompts, such as "A 55-year-old man with pneumonia."
- **Fine-Tuned Model**: A diffusion-based model fine-tuned using LoRA, optimized for medical imaging tasks with minimal computational overhead.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive front-end built with Streamlit for seamless interaction, allowing users to customize parameters and visualize results in real time.
- **Batch Processing**: Generate multiple images at once with options for batch downloads in a compressed ZIP file.
- **Scalable Backend**: A robust architecture using Flask, pyngrok, PyTorch, and diffusers, ensuring secure, efficient, and scalable performance.

## System Components

### **Model Architecture**
- Built on Stable Diffusion, incorporating advanced components:
  - **Text Encoder**: Encodes prompts into high-dimensional embeddings using CLIP.
  - **UNet with LoRA**: Processes latent representations and refines noisy images using attention mechanisms.
  - **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**: Compresses and reconstructs images while preserving fidelity.
  - **Denoising Diffusion Scheduler**: Manages noise addition and removal during the image generation process.
- LoRA integration ensures efficient fine-tuning by modifying only low-rank matrices within the UNet's attention layers.

### **Frontend**
- Developed using Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly experience.
- Features include:
  - Text-based input for clinical descriptions.
  - Configurable parameters: seed values, inference steps, and the number of images.
  - Real-time visualization of generated images.
  - Batch download functionality for efficient data handling.

### **Backend**
- Flask-based API for handling requests and communicating with the model.
- Secure remote access enabled through pyngrok.
- PyTorch and diffusers library for managing the model's operations and diffusion process.

## Key Performance Metrics

- **FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance)**: Measures alignment between generated and real images.
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure)**: Assesses structural fidelity of generated images.
- **Prompt Fidelity**: Over 92%, reflecting the model's ability to align outputs with user-defined text prompts.
- **Batch Processing**: Capable of generating and exporting large numbers of images efficiently.
- **Low Error Rate**: Ensures reliability and consistency across multiple runs.
